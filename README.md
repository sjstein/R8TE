A general purpose tracking tool for Run8 admins who use Discord.

Utilizing the "World Save" feature of the Run8 server we can track the state of trains.

(Note: The concept of a "train" is inferred by the first unit in a groupd of units being a locomotive)

Fundemental goals:
* Notify admins when an AI train has not moved in a certain amount of time ("stuck")
* Notify admins and players when an player controlled train has not moved in a certain amount of time
* Adjust thread tags (aka "Job posts") to indicate when a job has been taken or released

Secondary potential goals:
* Keep a mapping of route and track IDs to better identify where problematic trains are
* Track hours served by player / job

Possible add-on goals utilizing the defect detector files:
* Track miles covered
* Track speeds of trains
